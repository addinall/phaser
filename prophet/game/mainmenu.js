// Synopsis     : More experimentation using advanced HTML5 techniques.
//                This time using the Phaser JS library
//                Game1 is 90% from the tutorial that comes with the software.
//                I taught myself how to use this last night and decided
//                that the demos were fun, however, a game of
//                WHACK-THE-PROPHET would be a HOOT!
