 System       : Advanced HTML5 Game programming
 Date         : January 2016
 Author       : Mark Addinall
 Synopsis     : More experimentation using advanced HTML5 techniques.
                This time using the Phaser JS library
                I taught myself how to use this last night and decided
                that the demos were fun, however, a game of
                WHACK-THE-PROPHET would be a HOOT!

                Since about a billion people around the planet seem
                not to like Muslims very much at the moment, if I can
                sell a game to a million of the for $0.75 then
                I'm a happy chappie!  ;-)

                Been going on for a few days now.  I decided to tidy
                and formalise the structure according to the Phaser
                guidelines.  I didn't find the guidelines until
                after I wrote the game!
